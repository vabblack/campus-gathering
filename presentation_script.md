# Video Presentation Script: Campus Gathering Grid at LPU
**Duration**: 6 minutes

## Introduction (30 seconds)
Hello, I'm [Your Name], a student at Lovely Professional University (LPU). Welcome to my full stack development project, Campus Gathering Grid. Today, I'll cover the problem it solves, how I resolved it, its societal impact, and the technical details of how I built it. Let's get started!

## Section 1: Problem Statement (1 minute)
The problem my project addresses is the lack of an efficient platform for organizing and discovering events at LPU. Many students miss out on valuable opportunities because event information is scattered across different platforms or buried in emails. This leads to low attendance at events, missed networking opportunities, and a disconnected campus community. Campus Gathering Grid tackles this by providing a centralized, user-friendly platform for event management and discovery.

## Section 2: How the Problem is Resolved (1.5 minutes)
Campus Gathering Grid is a full stack web application designed to streamline LPU's event management. Its key features include:
- Real-time event creation and management
- User-friendly dashboard for event discovery
- Automated notifications for upcoming events
- Interactive RSVP system
- Event categories and filtering options

The app allows users to create, update, or browse events effortlessly, with all data synced in real-time. When an event is created, the system automatically notifies interested users based on their preferences. This ensures better event visibility and attendance. Here's a quick look at the app in action: [demonstrate creating an event and viewing it on the dashboard].

## Section 3: Societal Impact (1 minute)
Campus Gathering Grid impacts society by fostering a more connected and engaged campus community. By centralizing event information and making it easily accessible, it promotes student involvement and networking opportunities. This leads to:
- Increased participation in academic and social events
- Better networking opportunities for students
- Stronger campus community bonds
- More efficient use of campus resources
- Enhanced student experience through organized activities

While the immediate impact is on campus life, the ripple effects extend to creating more engaged and connected future professionals.

## Section 4: Technical Details - Coding and Functionality (2 minutes)

Let me take you behind the scenes of Campus Gathering Grid's technical architecture:

**Three-Tier Architecture**
I designed this application using a modern three-tier architecture with interactive user interfaces in the presentation layer, powerful business logic in the application layer, and secure data storage in the data layer. This approach separates concerns and makes the codebase maintainable and scalable.

**Frontend Technologies**
On the frontend, I built a dynamic experience using:
- React for building dynamic, component-based user interfaces
- React Router for seamless navigation between pages
- Tailwind CSS for responsive and customized styling
- TypeScript for type-safe code that catches errors before they reach production
- Axios for handling API requests and responses
- React Context API for global state management, especially for authentication

**Backend Technologies**
The backend leverages multiple technologies working together:
- Express.js for creating robust API routes and middleware
- MongoDB with Mongoose for flexible, schema-based data storage
- Nodemailer for handling email communications, including OTP delivery
- Bcrypt.js for secure password hashing and verification
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication and authorization

**Authentication Flow**
Our comprehensive authentication system includes:
- Secure registration with email verification via OTP
- Form validation with regex patterns for data integrity
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Token-based authentication with JWT for protected routes
- Secure password storage with bcrypt hashing

When a user registers:
1. Their information is validated and stored in MongoDB
2. A 6-digit OTP is generated and sent via email using Nodemailer
3. After verification, they're automatically logged in with a JWT token
4. All subsequent requests use this token for authentication


**Project Structure and Workflow**
The application follows a logical organization with dedicated directories for React components, backend services, models, and static assets. Throughout development, I followed industry best practices with Git version control, automated testing, and a CI/CD pipeline for streamlined deployment.

The combination of these technologies and practices creates a seamless experience where users can discover, create, and engage with campus events in real-time with minimal latency and maximum security.

## Conclusion (30 seconds)
To wrap up, Campus Gathering Grid solves the problem of fragmented campus event management by providing a centralized, user-friendly platform. It benefits the entire campus community by promoting engagement and connection. Built with modern technologies like React, Express.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS, this project demonstrates the power of full stack development in creating practical solutions. Working on this project taught me valuable lessons about user-centered design and scalable architecture. Thank you for watching!
